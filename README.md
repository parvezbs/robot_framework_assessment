# robot_framework_assessment

This is a sample automation suite using robot framework (ATDD framework) with python for custom functions.
In this project, we have a few automation tests that will automate the API end points of Amazon Ads developer end points 
to create and manage the ads and its stats. I have acquired the sandbox of amazon ads developers authorization tokens.

Alongside, Robot also provides capabilities to create web browser automation which is also illustrated in the framework.

The sample tests will talk about automation using trobot's DSL keywords, user defined keywords (definition of which is written in python)
And we have used free style test cases and templated test cases which is a robot framework advantage that gives the edge to re-use
the existing code. Robot's inbuilt reporting providing flexible logging and reporting.

To run: Import robot framework's urllib3, requests, chromedriver, selenium and json libraries.
